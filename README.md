# The Shit

*The Shit* is a better version of *The Fuck*, written in C++
Complete with Levenshtein autocorrect (Yaknow, that shit nobody knows how to spell so they use autocorrect to spell it for them)

Also, *The Shit* is INSTANT, unlike *The Fuck*, where it can take multiple seconds for it to come up with a result

*The Shit* was tested using ZSH. It is supposed to support Bash, but Bash is untested, please let me know if there are any issues with bash using *The Shit*
